# PolyWhirl

Polywhirl is a tiny program I wrote on a somewhat cramped overnight plane trip to Spain.
It uses the generalized idea of a [Polygon Spiral](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolygonalSpiral.html) which I'll call a _Polygon Wedge_ or _wedge_ for short and then plots all wedges. 
For fun, you can control which wedges are plotted by setting a modulus argument, allowing one to make surprisingly beautiful photos such as the one below.

It can also be used as an illustrative teaching tool for introducing polar coordinates as they are a very useful way to express the _n-gons_ and inner n-gon duals for constructing the wedges.
